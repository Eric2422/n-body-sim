A physics simulation for simulating the movement of charged particles. 

# Running the Simulation
To run the simulaiton, type `python src/main.py {config file name}`

# Config Files
The config files are used to set up the simulation and are located in [config/](./config/).
Each config file is a CSV.
A sample file named [sample.csv](./config/sample.csv) is provided. 

# Output Files
The output files store records the state of the particles over time and
are located in [output/](./output/).
A sample file named [sample.txt](./output/sample.txt) is provided.
